add-meta-charset:
  Type:	Boolean
  Default:	no
  Values:	no, yes
  This option, when enabled, adds a <meta> element and sets the charset attribute to the encoding of the document. Set this option to yes to enable it.
add-xml-decl:
  Type:	Boolean
  Default:	no
  Values:	no, yes
  See also:	char-encoding, output-encoding
  This option specifies if Tidy should add the XML declaration when outputting XML or XHTML.
  Note that if the input already includes an <?xml ... ?> declaration then this option will be ignored.
  If the encoding for the output is different from ascii, one of the utf* encodings, or raw, then the declaration is always added as required by the XML standard.
add-xml-space:
  Type:	Boolean
  Default:	no
  Values:	no, yes
  This option specifies if Tidy should add xml:space="preserve" to elements such as <pre>, <style> and <script> when generating XML.
  This is needed if the whitespace in such elements is to be parsed appropriately without having access to the DTD.
doctype:
  Type:	String
  Default:	auto
  This option specifies the DOCTYPE declaration generated by Tidy.
  If set to omit the output won't contain a DOCTYPE declaration. Note this this also implies numeric-entities is set to yes.
  If set to html5 the DOCTYPE is set to <!DOCTYPE html>.
  If set to auto (the default) Tidy will use an educated guess based upon the contents of the document. Note that selecting this option will not change the current document's DOCTYPE on output.
  If set to strict, Tidy will set the DOCTYPE to the HTML4 or XHTML1 strict DTD.
  If set to loose, the DOCTYPE is set to the HTML4 or XHTML1 loose (transitional) DTD.
  Alternatively, you can supply a string for the formal public identifier (FPI).
  For example:
  doctype: "-//ACME//DTD HTML 3.14159//EN"
  If you specify the FPI for an XHTML document, Tidy will set the system identifier to an empty string. For an HTML document, Tidy adds a system identifier only if one was already present in order to preserve the processing mode of some browsers. Tidy leaves the DOCTYPE for generic XML documents unchanged.
  This option does not offer a validation of document conformance.
input-xml:
  Type:	Boolean
  Default:	no
  Values:	no, yes
  This option specifies if Tidy should use the XML parser rather than the error correcting HTML parser.
output-html:
  Type:	Boolean
  Default:	no
  Values:	no, yes
  This option specifies if Tidy should generate pretty printed output, writing it as HTML.
output-xhtml:
  Type:	Boolean
  Default:	no
  Values:	no, yes
  This option specifies if Tidy should generate pretty printed output, writing it as extensible HTML.
  This option causes Tidy to set the DOCTYPE and default namespace as appropriate to XHTML, and will use the corrected value in output regardless of other sources.
  For XHTML, entities can be written as named or numeric entities according to the setting of numeric-entities.
  The original case of tags and attributes will be preserved, regardless of other options.
output-xml:
  Type:	Boolean
  Default:	no
  Values:	no, yes
  This option specifies if Tidy should pretty print output, writing it as well-formed XML.
  Any entities not defined in XML 1.0 will be written as numeric entities to allow them to be parsed by an XML parser.
  The original case of tags and attributes will be preserved, regardless of other options.
